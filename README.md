# Example of Theme with Content Collections

### How

1. Theme provides a dynamic route `/[...slug].astro` that creates routes using the `blog` Content Collection
2. User adds content to Collection (in this case `/playground/src/content/blog` for testing) and the markdown files are turned into pages
